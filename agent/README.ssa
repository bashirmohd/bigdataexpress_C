BDE Shared Storage

A. Design

It consists two modules: Shared Storage Agent (SSA) and Scanner.
The former communicats with BDE server and performs various commands.
The latter scans the file system bandwidth in parallel.
 
B. How to run

1. On bde1, 

go to the build directory

[root@bde1 bigdata-express-server]# cd build/agent/

run scannerd
./scannerd -c config/scannerd.bde1.json

2. Similarly on bd2,

[root@bde2 bigdata-express-server]# cd build/agent/

run scannerd

./scannerd -c config/scannerd.bde2.json

3. On bde1,

starts the SSA,

./bdeagent -c config/bdeagent.bde1.ssa.json


C. Notes on JSON 

1. An example scanner JSON.
{
    "name" : "Test SSA Scanner",
    "type" : "SSA Scanner",
    "id"   : "2",
    "iozone-executable": "/usr/local/bin/iozone",
    "data_folders" : {
        "path" : "/storage/lustre"
     },
     "OSTs" : "3-4",
     "sleep time": "1"
}

Different scanners are required to be assign different id, 
which can be a number or ascii string. Otherwise, the scan
results would be overwritten by other scanners.

Scanners and shared storage agent are required to be assigned
the same data_folders as of now. The path of data_folders
is the root dir of the file system.

Different scanners should scan different ranges of OSTs.

The sleep time is the duration (minutes) between two scans.
